                    FreeBoard is a place to share links about <i>almost</i> everything.
                    The goal of this platform is to give users a lot of different content. The more people use FreeBoard, the more it becomes interesting. 
                    <br>
                    There is no likes. No comments. 
                    This way, you are not only staring at "trends" or "hot". Every post have the same value as another one, despite of the content.
                    <br>
