          FreeBoard is a place to share links about <i>almost</i> everything.
          The goal of this platform is to give users a lot of different content. The more people use FreeBoard, the more it become interesting. 
          <br>
          There is no likes. No comments. 
          This way, you are not only staring at "trends" or "hot". Every post have the same value as another one, despite of the content.
          <br>
          We want to remind you that everything here is anonymous. But if you don't respect the  <a href="/rules">rules</a>, you will be banned.
