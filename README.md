## What is FreeBoard ?
[FreeBoard](http://www.freeboard.tech) is a place to share links to others, anonymously.
You can visit and try it [here](http://www.freeboard.tech). The goal of this platform is to give a user a lot of different content. The more people use FreeBoard, the more it become interesting. There is no votes. No comments. This way, you are not blocked in "trends" or "hot", every post have the same value as another one, despite of the content.
We wanted FreeBoard to be easy and fast to use, to encourage people sharing their knowledge, or what interest them. It also allow people to gain in visibility sharing their own blogs or projects.


## How to use FreeBoard
### Read posts :eyeglasses:
You have two options :
1. Go to Board to read the last posts
1. Go to Random if you want to see random posts

### Write a post :pencil2:
Go to 'Post'. Copy/paste the link you want to share, and write a legend in the text area. No account is needed.

Note that you can't send everything : once the Send button pressed, your post goes through some check functions to ensure nothing rude/illegal is sent.
